To understand a scientific paper you need to have good knowledge in the field and the math behind it. This is usually a tough task and consumes a lot of time and effort. 

In this project, we are trying to add simple tutorials with simple examples to some papers. The examples use python and matlab/octave to make it easier to understand. ITK and VTK will be used for image processing and visualisation tasks. 

Links will be added to the original papers and related useful materials. One can add related questions using github issues to add clearify or add more knowledge.
