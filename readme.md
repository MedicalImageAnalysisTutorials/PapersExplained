To understand a scientific paper you need to have good knowledge in the field and the math behind it. This is usually a tough task and consumes a lot of time and effort for many students. 

In this project, we are trying to add simple tutorials with examples to some well-known papers in computer science (hopefully in more fields in the future). The examples are written as opensource-code in python and/or matlab/octave to make it easier to understand. ITK and VTK will be used for image processing and visualisation tasks. 

Links will be added to the original papers and related useful materials. One can add related questions using github issues to add clearify or add more knowledge.
